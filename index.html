            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>This is a little story about me on the search for happiness during the never ending lockdowns of 2020-2021. It all started in March 2020 when we as a family got into a great habit of binge watching Drew Binsky's travel adventures on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/drewbinsky" target="_blank">Youtube.</a> As we spend 10 months on the road in 2018/2019 enjoying our family gap year around the world, we felt really trapped during the lockdown, like caged animals waiting to be unleashed again… So it's all Drew Binsky's fault :-) that one evening we bumped into this video about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Hof" target="_blank">Wim Hof</a>: 
            </p>
            <div id="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VF8dkjEdKNo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>My kids were gobsmacked and I WAS HOOKED!</p>
            <p>Since then, thanks to my obsession, our family has consumed a fair share of content on Wim Hof available on Youtube created by other youtubers, not just our favourite Drew Binsky.</p>

            <h2>"Unless you are willing to experience new things,<br>you'll never realize your full potential."<br> --Wim Hof</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="left-story">
            <p>Once the 1st looooong lockdown in the Czech Republic was over, I was exhausted and fed up and short of any inspiration for life… My kids only just got back to school - no homeschooling yippee!!! And I was researching the summer activities and holiday clubs available, as I jumped through the rabbit hole of Google like Alice in Wonderland, I came across a club that was offering a "Meditation in Ice" seminar. The instructors were offering a similar experience of Wim Hof seminar in the town nearby! Shall I go for a dip?<br>I was beyond intrigued.</p>
            <p>And then suddenly I received a phone call from my son's teacher known as a local open water swimming enthusiast. We exchanged a few words about the issue/solution and before Michael had a chance to say good-bye, I jumped in quickly: "Michael, would you mind me asking something about open water swimming?" "Sure, go ahead" he replied politely. "Have you ever done… ehm ice-baths? You know like Wim Hof method ice-baths? I found a local sports club organizing a Meditation in Ice weekend seminar…." And before I had a chance to finish off the sentence, Michael 'poured a bucket of cold water over my head': "Well, I wouldn't waste my money on it. If you want to experience something like that, just join our local open water swimming group and by the end of December, I can guarantee you that you'll experience an ice-bath. And for free. Now's the summer but we'll alway get back to it as a group in September. I'll text you. 
            </p>
            <p>First Sunday in September 2020, I was standing on the shore of the local lake and jumped in. The temperature of the water was 14 Degrees Celsius and I thought it was FREEEEEZING! Little did I know that Michael was right… by the end of December I was experiencing ice-bath at least once a week if not 2 or 3 times on some crazy occasions. </p>
            <p>Without any seminars, without even reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wim-Hof-Method-Potential-Transcend/dp/1846046297/" target="_blank">this famous book...</a></p>
            <div id="book">
                <img src="./assets/images/book-image.jpg" alt="the wim hof method book written by wim hof">
            </div>
            <p>HOW COME?</p>
            <p>Because I admitted to myself that I was bored and I needed to beat my lockdown blues by… doing something… else.<br>Because I was willing to experience something new and experiment.</p>
            <p>And because there was a positive peer pressure. There's nothing quite like a group of people that agree to meet up on Sunday morning on a lake shore, no matter what the weather, they all strip down and jump into the freezing lake.</p>
            <p>To be honest, if I was standing there myself, I don't think I'd be brave enough to do it, not even try it. But because the others are there, because the others show up, I want to show up - not just for them, but for myself.</p>
            <p>So, this is by no means my happily-ever-after. It's more like Get Freezing Happy Now recipe if:</p>
