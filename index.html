            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>This is a little story about me on the search for happiness during the never ending lockdowns of 2020-2021. It all started in March 2020 when we as a family got into a great habit of binge watching Drew Binsky’s travel adventures on Youtube. As we spend 10 months on the road in 2018/2019 enjoying our family gap year around the world, we felt really trapped during the lockdown, like caged animals waiting to be unleashed again… So it’s all Drew Binsky’s fault :-) that one evening we bumped into this video:

            <p>My kids were gobsmacked and I WAS HOOKED!<br>Since then, thanks to my obsession, our family has consumed a fair share of content on Wim Hof available on Youtube created by other youtubers, not just our favourite Drew Binsky.</p>
