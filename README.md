# Freezing Happy
 
The purpose of Freezing Happy is to inspire people to invest time in their health and regular self-care, to work on their immunity and potential, and also to spend more time outdoors by practising so-called Wim Hof Method and open water swimming.

This website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for the audience.

## Features

### The Landing Page Image

- The landing page includes an eye-catching photograph of a middle aged lady taking an ice-bath in a frozen lake and an attention grabbing tagline placed on the ‘red banner’.

### Our Story Section

- This section tells an authentic personal story and creates connection with a reader that is being introduced to the Wim Hof Method. This is also facilitated by the featured YouTube video ‘The Ice Man’ and the image of the Wim Hof book itself.
- These should spark interest of the reader and encourage her to consider ice-baths and cold therapy as a viable way to work on her self-care and immunity.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

The target audience (end users) of this project are predominantly females (but also males) from the age of 30+ looking for information about practicing the so-called 'Wim Hof Method', ice baths, cold therapy and open water swimming. It is aimed at this type of audience as my personal story ('mum of two trying to survive lockdowns and maintain some sanity during the pandemic') can resonate with them.

The end user is looking for inspiration and credibility of the Wim Hof Method.

The benefit of this project is to highlight that “ordinary people” can push their personal boundaries, create extraordinary outdoor experiences while increasing their physical and mental health and fitness at the same time. 

Other features that are not to be missed is that the user can, if they wish, get in touch to obtain more information about the regular ice-baths and open water swimming meetups, possibly join the group if they’re local, subscribe to the newsletter and easily navigate to the social links.

- As an end user I want to get inspired to try out the Wim Hof Method to find content about the ice-baths, cold therapy, open water swimming, and their benefits.
- As an end user I want to find all this information easily, without too many clicks.
- As an end user I want to be able to subscribe to the newsletter so that I can receive more regular updates on the Wim Hof Method in practice and regular meetups of the group. 
- As an end user I want to be able to find website owner's contact details and social links, so that I could get in touch and follow easily.
- As an end user I want to be able to view this information on a variety of devices: a desktop, mobile phone and tablet.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used
- HTML5
- CSS3

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used

- [Pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com/): Pixabay was originally used to find images but images found thanks to iStock ad placed on the site
- [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/): [Canva Color Palette Generator](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) was used to create [my color palette](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQFfVufLElq5SqE56QDL7nFfoI3bhFWDxp9opZS1hYrAaxy3xVWU4ntsD4DvSYZcEZgi_9Ez7hbboe5/pub) and Canva was used to create [my wireframe design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJwBfbEYS5F_1b5bzXBn2bcpLrGb8VKd/view?usp=sharing), and for resizing and editing images.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Google fonts were used to import the ‘Lato’ and 'Licorice' fonts into the style.css files. My favourite font Lato was used throughout the project, Canva font 'Inspiration' was not available on GoogleFonts, therefore was replaced by the font 'Licorice' and used on banners for decorative purposes.
- Git: Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal - to commit to Git and push to GitHub
- GitHub: Github is used to store the project's code after being pushed from Git.
- GoogleDev Tools used to see the element positioning and responsiveness
